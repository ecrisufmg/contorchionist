# contorchionist

*contorchionist* is a C++ project that leverages the power of `libtorch` (the C++ backend of PyTorch) to implement audio processing, machine listening, and machine learning functionalities. The main goal is to provide a unified framework that can be seamlessly integrated into various real-time and non-real-time environments, such as Pure Data (PD), Max, and Python.

Inspired by existing tools that bridge the gap between creative coding environments and powerful machine learning libraries, *contorchionist* aims to offer a flexible and extensible solution for artists, researchers, and developers.

The project is currently in its early stages of development. It is strongly inspired by projects like [FluCoMa](https://flucoma.org), [timbreID](https://github.com/wbrent/timbreIDLib/), [SCMIR](https://composerprogrammer.com/code.html), [nn~](https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde), and others: check them for a more ready-to-use experience!

## Compilation

At this moment, we do not provide pre-compiled binaries. To use the library, you need to compile it for your specific environment and language by modifying the options in the main `CMakeLists.txt` file.

## Acknowledgments

This project is developed at the **Espaço de Criação e Investigação Sonora (ECrIS)**, a laboratory part of the Center for Research in Contemporary Music (CPMC) at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), with support from CNPq and FAPEMIG.
